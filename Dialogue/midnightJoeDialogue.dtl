"Midnight Joe": The infamous Hatchet, doing the biddings of that despicable Chiyou.
"Midnight Joe": Sorry I couldn’t greet you at the front door along with my people. I was having a bit of… an episode. The Bounty has been quite an adjustment. I can feel my wits slipping.
"Midnight Joe": What’d Chiyou offer you, a share of this Bounty? 
"Midnight Joe": The Saint’s Bounty is not his to share.
"Midnight Joe": I’ve no quarrel with you, but you’ve destroyed most of my gang. I know better than to expect a happy ending from this. This is it for one of us.
"Midnight Joe": I can’t say I’m happy with what the bounty has done to me. But maybe I’ll stand a chance against a freak like you.

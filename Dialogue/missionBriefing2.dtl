Chiyou: It seems like Midnight Joe is now in a state of eternal slumber. Filled with eternal nightmares, I hope.
Chiyou: You did well for your first target. Your payment will be sent to you immediately. Now letâ€™s discuss your next job.

Chiyou: Your second target will be the scientist, Mirage.
Chiyou: He is a leading scientist in the field of Bounty studies under my employment.
Chiyou: Unfortunately, it has been brought to my attention that he has been pilfering my Saints Bounty.
Chiyou: It's a shame to lose a talent like his but there will be no exceptions in how I deal with those who thieve from me.
Chiyou: Head to his laboratory and dispose of him and his minions. We will speak afterwards.
